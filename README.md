# football-highlights-app

This app uses a football highlight api to embed videos of latest football highlights in the top divisions. The data is randomly picked and when refreshed the next available highlight is available to enjoy! Why trawl through youtube when you can come and use this app to get your football fix.

The mini project was undertaken to cement my understanding of API's and rendering the data onto a webpage.
